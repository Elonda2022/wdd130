    <p>Good day, everyone!
        Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am your brother and I live in Kinshasa, DR Congo. 
        I was born into a family of seven children. I am currently a married father of four children. 
        The first is 6 years old, the second is 4 years old, the third is 3 years old, and the fourth is 1 year old.</p>
        <p>I completed my mission in Lubumbashi, DR Congo. I'm at BYUI to further my career in technology. 
        I enjoy working with other people so much.</p>
        <p>I am delighted to be in that class with you and We're all together.
        </p>
