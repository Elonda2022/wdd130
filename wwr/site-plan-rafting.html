    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>I used thing on how I came to join the Letter Days Saints Church of Jesus Christ. Prior to joining the church, my family—mom, dad, brothers, 
        and sisters—and I attended Protestant churches together.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>When I joined in the institute of religion, it was weird to witness people talking about the bible. One day, I met missionaries who taught me about the gospel. 
        I made my final decision to join the church on that day. means that the spirit really touched me. The moment I decided to join was the very time that my family's problems began. 
        They did not approve of my conversion. I convinced myself that I had found the truth, so why then would my family disapprove of me?
        I was once more strengthening myself with Bible verse research when I read: "If you need to follow me, charge yourself with your cross. 
        "I choose once more to follow Christ, which means things won't always be simple for me, but I must always do what is right even when it is uncomfortable
        </p>
        <p>
            But then, when my aunt went to meet my mother that day, it seemed like a battle regarding my membership in the Church of Jesus Christ, and she stated many unfavorable things 
            about the church. I was astonished again that my aunty had gone to see my mother that day. My mother did not accept my progress in the church when I got home, and she once 
            more told me to leave. The only thing I can recall saying to her was, "I am in the right way" and after looking at me, she responded, "Okay, if you feel comfortable, please 
            go ahead. However, don't forget, if you feel there are any mistakes, leave the church." I said okay  
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, as I now understand the church, it was time for me to share my knowledge by serving as a missionary. My young brother was the first to share the gospel. I remember 
            that when he was young enough, making the proper choice was impossible. It was now time for his parents to approve of his baptism after he begins the lesson with 
            the missionary at the end. I kept reminding myself over and over again that the greatest way to help my small brother is to belong to the appropriate church, but in the end, 
            mom said, "My child cannot be the member of the church because is too young." Never mind, tell my young brother that you will someday join the church while I'm getting ready 
            for my mission. The only thing I can think of is taking my university tuition to pay for my passport as part of my mission preparation. Going to the mission was such a major 
            decision that I made for myself. When my passport was prepared and everything on my end was in order, I started getting ready to go on the mission. My father told me to do 
            well and complete my mission during our conversation before I left. My mother also joined us in our discussion. My mother said nothing after my dad made that comment. 
            I assured them that I will be back in two years. I prayed that everyone in my family would join the church. That's what I wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I entered the temple for the first time, I just had one purpose: to baptize my deceased great grandpa. As soon as I think about my mother's advice to leave the 
            church if you notice anything different, the perplexity disappears, and I am once more at good with my choices. I will never forget how happy I was to perform ordinances 
            for them on my first day in the temple. With reference to the Scriptures, my heart and spirit were once more open. Everything the Bible claimed about the temple was true 
            on the day I discovered it. After my temple visit, I take my time, go home, and read the Bible again. The Old Testament was my main source of inspiration since that is the 
            part of the Bible that made the temple apparent to me. I hear that my grandfather passed away on my mission. I was really at ease when I heard that news because of my 
            knowledge and understanding of what would happen after that. I merely thanked God for doing that in my prayer.

            happened and now I feel, some of us can have the same story in the church but being a pioneer in the church is not always simple but is possible. The good result is 
            I am married in the temple, my father and mom also sisters and brethren are members of the church for 1 year now. My young brother was the second to join the church he server 
            also the mission. This is a bless for us.
