        <p>I used thing on how I came to join the Letter Days Saints Church of Jesus Christ. Prior to joining the church,
            my family—mom, dad, brothers, and sisters—and I attended Protestant churches together.</p>
            <p>
                When I joined in the institute of religion, it was weird to witness people talking about the bible. One day, 
                I met missionaries who taught me about the gospel. I made my final decision to join the church on that day. means 
                that the spirit really touched me. The moment I decided to join was the very time that my family's problems began. 
                They did not approve of my conversion. I convinced myself that I had found the truth, so why then would my family 
                disapprove of me? I was once more strengthening myself with Bible verse research when I read: "If you need to follow me, 
                charge yourself with your cross. "I choose once more to follow Christ, which means things won't always be simple for me, 
                but I must always do what is right even when it is uncomfortable.
